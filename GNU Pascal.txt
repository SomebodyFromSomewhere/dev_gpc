** Using your own GNU Pascal compiler system with Dev-Pascal **

If you already have a GNU Pascal compiler system and have installed the executable version of Dev-Pascal, you can configure Dev-Pascal to work with it. Please follow the instructions below :

1. Open Dev-Pascal, and go to the Options menu, then Compiler options

2. In the Directories sheet page, type in the Bin field the directory that contains the GNU Pascal compiler: "gpc.exe" (example : c:\mingw\bin\)

3. Type in the Units field a list of directories to your personal GNU Pascal unit files. Separate paths by semicolon (;). Example : c:\mingw\units\;c:\mingw\winapi\

4. Type in the Lib field the directory to your Mingw (or Cygwin) library files (example : c:\mingw\lib\)

5. Select "GNU Pascal" in the "Pascal compiler" tab.

6. Click OK in the Compiler Options dialog. Your GNU Pascal compiler system should be now configured to work with Dev-Pascal.
